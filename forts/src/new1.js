                    <p>Rajgad (literal meaning Ruling Fort) is a hill fort situated in the Pune district of Maharashtra, India. Formerly known as Murumdev, the fort was the capital of the Maratha Empire under the rule of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj for almost 26 years, after which the capital was moved to the Raigad Fort.[1] Treasures discovered from an adjacent fort called Torna were used to completely build and fortify the Rajgad Fort.</p>
