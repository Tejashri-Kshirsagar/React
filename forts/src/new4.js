                <p>Pratapgad literally 'Valour Fort' is a large mountain fort located in Satara district, in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra. The fort's historical significance is due to the Battle of Pratapgad in 1659. The Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj commissioned Moropant Trimbak Pingle, his prime minister, to undertake the construction of this fort in order to defend the banks of the Nira and the Koyna rivers.</p>
